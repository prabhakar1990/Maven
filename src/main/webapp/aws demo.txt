EBS(Elastic block storage) is just like a external hard drive

EFS: Connnect the two latop with single hard drice is EFS
In EFS :Dats is stored across multiple AZ'S within a region
There are total 20 diff regions

Regions that have maximum no of avali zone..North Viginia(has 6 Ava zone )

--group of dataa cemter comibned togntehr to form  Availazilty zone

--Mulktiple availablirty zone form a Region

S3: virtually unlimited staorage has S3

Object has limit of 1TB

How may copy it will take for S3 bucket:how may no of copies does AWS will keep behind S3 scene: :Anser is 6
--You can push the datat glacier by CLI or SDK not by GUI
---total 137 or 140 services in AWS


--combining all services and features it is almost==5k 

-Durablity means: my data is not lost

-----fault tolerance is much more than one layer high availability
--cloud formation is as IAAC--infrastaurture as a code to sydeny region from mumbai
converting complete archiecture to code is cloud formation, it genertars an infarstructure code for ME
----AMI is just like a CD
--Cloud formation is just like a JSON format
--AWS  lamda: moustache example

wat is maxium time period for executing lamda: ans is 5 to 15 min(100milisec to 15 sec)
--appliaction code is wrritten in LAMDA function
--behind the scenes lamda is an conatiner based serrvices
--RTO--Recovery time  objective(How much time i took to bring out my systtem to normal state)
--RPO--Recovery point objective(every night 12 o clock i am taking backup of appliacation is RPO)

Amazon life cycle policy:Amazon S3 IA(infrequent access)--retrive my data once in a 3 days--
--S3 6 copies across multiple availablity zone
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RDS (mini DBA)--ex-patching backing up etc manxim capacity--in this 6 databases(mysql, maria, postgressql and arora) are supported==16 GM
Amazon dynamo DB(no sql solution):unsrtuctured data, horizontal scaling--  maximiim capacity(how much data):1.6 Petabytes
Amazon Redshift manxim (capacity is

---Read capacity : just for one day i wnated to incrase from 5 to 10
--
--Cloud front(right in front) is cache solution

--how many no of Cloudfront/edgelocation(mini data cenater where cache contnet are kept) :its close to 150

--11 edge laoction we have delhi mumbai,etc

WAF: web access firewall
AWS shield?

-exapanding one single machine to work much better(exapanding RAM) is vertical scaling

--muiltiple laptop conneting to one single switch horizontal scaling

Load balacing is just like a project manager-

VPC is at network level
IIM
-------------------------

VPC--as lay man language:its is public cloud and want  a private network area as data center

ex villa--visitors room-(is public subnet)---private room(private subnet)



Public is exposed to everybody--dooor inside visitor room is IGW(internatgateway)

NAT will help him go outside from private

Baston host  isjump server?

--Nacle behaviour is international airport

--AWS config is mini version of cloud trail

--thresold of 70%--the moment you hit 70%
